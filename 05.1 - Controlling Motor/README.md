# AccelStepper-Examples
IxLab examples codes for stepper motors based on by Mike McCauley AccelStepper library (mikem@airspayce.com)

  - Constant speed example: Shows how to run AccelStepper in the simplest, fixed speed mode with no accelerations.
  - Run to position example: Shows how to use runToNewPosition which sets a new target position and then waits until the stepper has achieved it.
  - Bounce example: Make a single stepper bounce from one limit to another.
  - Knot stepper example: Make a single stepper follow the analog value read from a pot or whatever. The stepper will move at a constant speed to each newly set posiiton, depending on the value of the pot.
  - Multi stepper example: Shows how to use multiple simultaneous steppers.
  - Random example: Make a single stepper perform random changes in speed, position and acceleration.
