# 3 Axis Analog Accelerometer

## Introduction
The 3 Axis Analog Accelerometer, as it name suggests, is used to detect acceleration along three axes: **left-right(X), forward-backward(Y), up/down(Z)**. It can not only detect motion, but also gravitational acceleration, and therefore can be used to detect tilt along these axes as well. The accelerometers we keep in stock are ADXL335 which have 6 pins: VCC, GND, X, Y, Z, Self-Test(ST). Since the ST pin is used only for testing purposes, we do not need to connect that pin for normal usage.
